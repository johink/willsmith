    "## Neural Network Details\n",
    "\n",
    "This neural network takes as an input the raw board representation s of the position and its history, and outputs both move probabilities and a value, (p, v) =  f(s). \n",
    "\n",
    "The vector of move probabilities p represents the probability of selecting each move a, pa =  Pr(a| s). \n",
    "The value v is a scalar evaluation, estimating the probability of the current player winning from position s\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "The input to the neural network is a 19 ×  19 ×  17 image stack comprising 17 binary feature planes. Eight feature planes, Xt, consist of binary values indicating the presence of the current player’s stones ($X_t^i = 1$ if intersection i contains a stone of the player’s colour at time-step t; 0 if the intersection is empty, contains an opponent stone, or if t <  0). \n",
    "\n",
    "A further 8 feature planes, Yt, represent the corresponding features for the opponent’s stones. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final feature plane, C, represents the colour to play, and has a constant value of either 1 if black is to play or 0 if white is to play. \n",
    "\n",
    "These planes are concatenated together to give input features st =  [Xt, Yt, Xt−1, Yt−1,..., Xt−7, Yt−7, C]. \n",
    "\n",
    "History features Xt, Yt are necessary, because Go is not fully observable solely from the current stones, as repetitions are forbidden; similarly, the colour feature C is necessary, because the komi is not observable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input:  3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3\n",
    "\n",
    "- a 3 x 3 grid of 3 x 3 spaces, where 1 indicates that x owns that space\n",
    "- a 3 x 3 grid of 3 x 3 spaces, where 1 indicates that o owns that space\n",
    "- a 3 x 3 grid of 3 x 3 spaces, where 1 indicates that x is playing, 0 indicates o is playing\n",
    "\n",
    "Tic Tac Toe doesn't need history information\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing\n",
    "The input features are processed by a residual tower that consists of a single convolutional block followed by either 19 or 39 residual blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolutional block applies the following modules:\n",
    "* A convolution of 256 filters of kernel size 3 ×  3 with stride 1\n",
    "* Batch normalization\n",
    "* A rectifier nonlinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "Each residual block applies the following modules sequentially to its input:\n",
    "* A convolution of 256 filters of kernel size 3 ×  3 with stride 1\n",
    "* Batch normalization\n",
    "* A rectifier nonlinearity\n",
    "* A convolution of 256 filters of kernel size 3 ×  3 with stride 1\n",
    "* Batch normalization\n",
    "* A skip connection that adds the input to the block\n",
    "* A rectifier nonlinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the residual tower is passed into two separate ‘heads’ for  computing the policy and value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The policy head applies the following modules:\n",
    "* A convolution of 2 filters of kernel size 1 ×  1 with stride 1\n",
    "* Batch normalization\n",
    "* A rectifier nonlinearity\n",
    "* A fully connected linear layer that outputs a vector of size 192 +  1  =   362, corresponding to logit probabilities for all intersections and the pass move\n",
    "\n",
    "The value head applies the following modules:\n",
    "* A convolution of 1 filter of kernel size 1 ×  1 with stride 1\n",
    "* Batch normalization \n",
    "* A rectifier nonlinearity\n",
    "* A fully connected linear layer to a hidden layer of size 256\n",
    "* A rectifier nonlinearity\n",
    "* A fully connected linear layer to a scalar\n",
    "* A tanh nonlinearity outputting a scalar in the range [− 1,  1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall network depth, in the 20- or 40-block network, is 39 or 79 parameterized layers, respectively, for the residual tower, plus an additional 2 layers for the policy head and 3 layers for the value head."

    "## Domain Knowledge Provided to AlphaGo\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) AlphaGo Zero is provided with perfect knowledge of the game rules. These are used during MCTS, to simulate the positions resulting from a sequence of moves, and to score any simulations that reach a terminal state. Games terminate when both players pass or after 19 ×   19 ×  2 =  722 moves. In addition, the player is provided with the set of legal moves in each position.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) AlphaGo Zero uses Tromp–Taylor scoring during MCTS simulations and self-play training. This is because human scores (Chinese, Japanese or Korean rules) are not well-defined if the game terminates before territorial boundaries are resolved. However, all tournament and evaluation games were scored using Chinese rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) The input features describing the position are structured as a 19 ×  19  image; that is, the neural network architecture is matched to the grid-structure of the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) The rules of Go are invariant under rotation and reflection; this knowledge has been used in AlphaGo Zero both by augmenting the dataset during training to include rotations and reflections of each position, and to sample random rotations or reflections of the position during MCTS (see Search algorithm). Aside from komi, the rules of Go are also invariant to colour transposition; this knowledge is exploited by representing the board from the perspective of the current player (see Neural network architecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "AlphaGo Zero does not use any form of domain knowledge beyond the points listed above. It only uses its deep neural network to evaluate leaf nodes and to select moves (see ‘Search algorithm’). It does not use any rollout policy or tree policy, and the MCTS is not augmented by any other heuristics or domain-specific rules. No legal moves are excluded—even those filling in the player’s own eyes (a standard heuristic used in all previous programs)."
