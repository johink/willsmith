class NestedTTT(Game):
    """
    A game of Nested Tic-Tac-Toe, where each square on the outer board 
    is another Tic-Tac-Toe board.

    The game is played as standard Tic-Tac-Toe, except there are 9 inner 
    boards to make moves on.  Winning an inner board claims that space for 
    the winner on the outer board.  Draws result in a square that does not 
    count for either side.  Winning the game requires winning 3 inner boards 
    in a row, forming a win on the outer board.

    The state of the game is stored using the TTTBoard class:  one for the 
    outer board and one for each of the 9 inner boards.  Actions are never 
    explicitly taken by the players on the outer board, only as a result of a 
    win on an inner board.

    See Game documentation for the public API expected by other classes.

        position for each, is also initialized.  This enables faster checking
